Thanks for downloading the v0.2.1 demo for Doki Doki Date Club!

1.) Browse to DDLC's game directory on your computer.
If you installed DDLC through Steam, find it in your library, right-click it, and click "Properties." In the window that opens, click on the "Local Files" tab, then click the "Browse Local Files" button. This will open up the game directory.
If you DID NOT install DDLC through Steam, you will have to find the game directory on your own.

2.) If the game is a clean installation that has never been run, move on to step 3.
If the game is not a clean installation and has been run, but no other mods have been installed, navigate to the "game" folder and delete the "firstrun" file. Move on to step 3.
If you have another mod installed, reinstall the game, then move on to step 3.

3.) Since you are reading this README, it is assumed that you have extracted the files from the compressed archive.

Move the contents of the game folder (./game) into the game directory of the DDLC directory. You should be asked if you want to replace files, and you should do so.
Also make sure to remove scripts.rpa from the game directory. The .rpyc files will account for the scripts.rpa file.

4.) The mod files have now been installed. Simply run the game and enjoy the demo!
